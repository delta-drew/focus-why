# focus-why
Stopwatch to log work/study time. Image carousel in the background with photos of "why" motivator. (what drives me forward) 
This will be my first github project, and my first time building a complete, dynamic web app. (if it's even considered that?) 
The goal is to have attractive CSS and clean functionality of the UX/UI. 
In the background will be a slowly rotating carousel with photos of my "why" motivators. 
Photos of my son, images that represent remote income and freedom of schedule, etc.
Images will be able to be added to the carousel by uploading files when prompted by a pop-up after clicking a discreet button at the top of the page. 
In the foreground will be a semitransparent stopwatch counting upward. Hours, minutes, seconds. 
Below it will be buttons that say "stop" "log" and "reset". 
The stop button will change to say "start" when it's been pressed and the clock has stopped. 
The log function will add it to a section on the page where the time is recorded, named "time logs" showing the timestamp of the date and how much time was on the clocks. 
At the bottom of the time log box will be the total time, aggregated total of the individual logs.

I know this isn't the most simple of all first projects, but it should be simple enough, and it still presents a lot of sufficient challenges at my current skill level, forcing me to adapt and learn along the way.
